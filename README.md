# Filling Gaps in Social Demographic Data

# About
This project was done during an internship with East Bay Community Energy, the largest provider of clean energy in the East Bay of California.
The first half of the project was completed in SQL on Google Cloud Platform to construct new features from energy consumption data on a customer level.
The second half was a machine learning model that uses a labeled data set of social demographic characteristics, energy data, and alternative data (e.g., census data, building characteristics data) to predict the social demographics of customers for which data doesn't exist.

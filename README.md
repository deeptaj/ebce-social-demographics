# Filling Gaps in Social Demographic Data

# About
This project was done during an internship with East Bay Community Energy, the largest provider of clean energy in the East Bay of California. 
The end result was a machine learning model that uses a labeled data set of social demographic characteristics, energy data, and alternative data (e.g., census data, building characteristics data) to predict the social demographics of customers for which data doesn't exist.
